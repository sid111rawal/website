Front-End Frameworks: Use a modern JavaScript framework for fast, interactive UIs. Common choices are React (e.g. with Next.js or Gatsby for SSR/SSG), Vue.js (with Nuxt), or Svelte (with SvelteKit). For example, Next.js (React) supports server-side rendering and static generation, making pages load quickly and SEO-friendly

. Complement these with a utility-first CSS framework like Tailwind CSS for rapid, custom styling

. You can also use component libraries or primitives (e.g. Radix UI
radix-ui.com
) for accessible, pre-built UI elements, and Framer Motion for smooth animations and interactive effects

.
Back-End Options: If you need dynamic functionality (form handling, authentication, database), common backends include Node.js (e.g. Express or Fastify) with a database (MongoDB, PostgreSQL) or Python (Django/Flask) or Ruby on Rails. For instance, Express.js is a minimal, flexible Node framework well-suited for custom APIs or form handling, often paired with MongoDB for data storage

. You could also choose a serverless approach (Firebase Functions, AWS Lambda, Supabase) if you prefer no-maintenance back-end. If your site is mostly static, you might skip a full backend and rely on third-party services (see Form Handling below).
Full-Stack Frameworks / Static Site Generators: Consider frameworks that bundle front-end and deployment: Next.js (React), Nuxt.js (Vue), or SvelteKit provide full-stack or hybrid static options with built-in routing. Astro and Gatsby are great for static-heavy sites (personal portfolio/blog). These allow pre-rendering pages (SSG) for performance and SEO, while still supporting dynamic features via APIs. Many developers use Jamstack (static site + headless APIs) to combine fast delivery with CMS/blog content.
CMS / Blog Systems: For a blog or frequent updates, a headless CMS or blog platform is helpful. Options include Contentful, Sanity, Strapi, or Ghost (headless mode). These let you manage posts and project details separately from code. For example, Contentful or Sanity integrate well with Next.js and allow editing content without redeploying

. You could also use WordPress as a headless CMS or a simple markdown-based blog (e.g. MDX with Next.js). Choose what you (and any non-technical collaborators) find easiest.
Payment Integration: To sell digital products, subscriptions, or services, use trusted payment platforms. Stripe is a developer-friendly choice with excellent API docs. Lemon Squeezy is another option that handles VAT/taxes and supports 21+ payment methods. PayPal or Paddle can also be integrated for one-time or recurring payments. For static sites, tools like Snipcart or Gumroad offer easy checkout integration. In any case, embed “Buy” or “Subscribe” buttons that trigger a Stripe/LemonSqueezy checkout flow.
Hosting & Deployment: Deploy on platforms optimized for modern frontends. Vercel is ideal for Next.js or any static sites – it offers seamless Git integration, automatic builds, and global CDN hosting

. Netlify similarly provides instant deployment and form handling for static sites. For full control or backends, consider AWS (Amplify, S3/CloudFront), DigitalOcean App Platform, Heroku, or Cloudflare Pages. In all cases, use SSL (HTTPS) and a custom domain. These platforms support instant rollbacks and preview URLs for each pull request, simplifying testing.
CI/CD & DevOps: Automate your build, test, and deploy pipeline. GitHub Actions or GitLab CI can run tests and build your site on each push. Netlify/Vercel have built-in CI that deploys on git commits. For example, a GitHub Action could lint and build your site, then Vercel auto-deploys the production build. Containerization (Docker) or IaC tools (Terraform/CloudFormation for infrastructure) may be overkill for a personal site, but consider basic linting (ESLint, Stylelint) and formatting (Prettier) in your pipeline to maintain code quality

Analytics & SEO: Monitor traffic with Google Analytics (industry standard) or a privacy-friendly alternative like Plausible
dev.to
. Add a blog to boost SEO; include descriptive title/meta tags on every page, alt text on images, and a sitemap/robots.txt. Use SSR/SSG features of your framework (e.g. Next.js) to pre-render pages for better SEO
dev.to
. You can also deploy your site to Google Search Console and add Open Graph/Twitter cards for social sharing.
Form Handling: For contact or sign-up forms on a static site, consider services like Formspree or Netlify Forms
dev.to
. They collect form submissions (e.g. send you an email) without writing your own backend. If using a backend, a simple Express route or serverless function can process the form. Also add spam protection (reCAPTCHA) and email notifications. Test forms thoroughly to ensure reliable lead capture.
